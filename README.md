# Kanbas
This project is a recreation of Canvas, a popular learning management system used by Universities. The project is built using the ReactJS framework, with Javascript, HTML, and CSS for the front-end. It also makes use of Bootstrap for styling. The backend is done using Node.js, and the relevant code is in my [kanbas-node-server-app](https://github.com/veeeena/kanbas-node-server-app) repository. 

The application supports CRUD operations for courses, modules within individual courses, assignments within individual courses, and users.

The website's frontend is hosted on [Netlify](https://main--coruscating-gumption-a7498b.netlify.app/#/Kanbas).
